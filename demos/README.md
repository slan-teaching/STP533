# johnson-wichern-examples
Selected examples from Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis (Johnson &amp; Wichern, 2007) in R

The examples chosen are those that I use in my STAT-740 course. In particular, this course covers chapters 1-6 and 8-9. 

Data files (.dat) are available from the publisher website (https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/product/Johnson-Applied-Multivariate-Statistical-Analysis-6th-Edition/9780131877153.html) and numerous places online (e.g. http://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~dzimmer/multivariate/Wichern_data.zip)
